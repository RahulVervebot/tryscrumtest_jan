                  At the end of the day, an organisation's teams exist to create value by solving specific needs. Now while trying to create value, the teams may have to overcome many challenges. When the team isn't self-sufficient to decide or change a direction, it delays customer value delivery. Now with the daunting demands in the market, even the slightest delay diminishes the value the team produces.

                    <li>This autonomy, in turn, increases team engagement as they will feel accountable as a team.</li>

                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>forming</strong> stage, the team members will have limited information about their existence as a team. Like, they may need clarity about their roles & responsibilities, team goals, team values, relationship with other team members, and their relationship with other teams in the organisation.

                  Here is where the team coach needs to increase the awareness of what they need to know about themselves. Then, coaches introduce tools like <a href="https://theteamcanvas.com/" target="_blank">Team Canvas</a> to help teams create their identity and understand their existence as a team.

                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>storming</strong> stage, the team members will start to have ideological differences, cultural differences, political differences, etc. The differences will inherently create the toxins like blaming, contempt, stonewalling, and defensiveness (Four Team Toxins from ORSC) within the team.

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  At the end of the day, an organisation's teams exist to create value by solving specific needs. Now while trying to create value, the teams may have to overcome many challenges. When the team isn't self-sufficient to decide or change a direction, it delays customer value delivery. Now with the daunting demands in the market, even the slightest delay diminishes the value the team produces.
                </p>
                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  A team with self-management capabilities can

                    <li> <b>â€”</b> Adapt to challenges as they will have the autonomy to decide within boundaries. They don't have to wait for approval outside of the team.</li>
                    <li> <b>â€”</b> Adapt to changing needs as they can re-order their work based on priority or value.</li>
                    <li> <b>â€”</b> This autonomy, in turn, increases team engagement as they will feel accountable as a team.</li>
                  </ul>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  So a team to be responsive, self-management is one of the crucial components. It often differentiates a great team from a good team.

                  Teams are not effective teams right from day one. It goes through a journey before becoming a real or performing team. We have representations from J-Cure or Tuckman's team development model to help us understand the journey.

                  So, for a team to be self-managing, the foundations of self-management capabilities need to be built into the team.
                </p>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>forming</strong> stage, the team members will have limited information about their existence as a team. Like, they may need clarity about their roles & responsibilities, team goals, team values, relationship with other team members, and their relationship with other teams in the organisation.
                </p>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  Here is where the team coach needs to increase the awareness of what they need to know about themselves. Then, coaches introduce tools like <a href="https://theteamcanvas.com/" target="_blank">Team Canvas</a> to help teams create their identity and understand their existence as a team.
                </p>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>storming</strong> stage, the team members will start to have ideological differences, cultural differences, political differences, etc. The differences will inherently create the toxins like blaming, contempt, stonewalling, and defensiveness (Four Team Toxins from ORSC) within the team.
                </p>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  Here is where the team coach needs to be mindful of helping them to create trust & Psychological safety within the team. This stage can easily break or make the team. Coaches can introduce tools like <a href="https://crrglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Figure-17-Example-Designing-The-Team-Alliance-DTA.pdf" target="_blank">Design Team Alliance (DTA)</a> and <a href="https://responsibility.com/responsibility-process/" target="_blank">Responsibility</a> Process to help teams understand how they want to be when things are difficult.

                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>Norming</strong> stage, the team starts forming their processes and working ways. Then, the team begins to make consensus-based decisions for themselves. Here is where the coach helps the team accumulate the benefits of teamwork.
                </p>

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", paddingTop: "20px", textAlign: "justify" }} >
                  Introducing Self-assessment tools like <a href="https://www.comparativeagility.com/capabilities/psychological-safety-assessment" target="_blank">Psychological safety assessment</a> and <a href="https://www.comparativeagility.com/capabilities/inspired-teams-assessment" target="_blank">Team Maturity Assessment</a> helps the team understand their current maturity and take actionable steps to improve their effectiveness as a team continuously.

                  In the <strong style={{ color: "#012237" }}>Performing</strong> stage, the team knows their strategic connect and alignment towards the organisation's vision. Then, it starts achieving its goals to deliver value. Here, the coach can promote a high degree of self-management by being invisibly present.

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", textAlign: "justify" }} >A cross-functional team with all the necessary skills to fulfil any need or add value is the foundation for any team's self-management. So a coach working with organisation leaders to set guardrails for team formation, considering technical and functional expertise needed for a team, can lay the foundation for self-management. Then, when team members can choose their teams based on the guardrails set, it can set the tone for self-management.

                <p className="lead" style={{ color: "black", textAlign: "justify" }} >Goals provide flexibility for trade-offs.
